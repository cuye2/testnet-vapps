## Project

### Name & Category
- **Project**: zkID Reputation Passport
- **Category**: identity

### Description
zkID Reputation Passport is a privacy-preserving decentralized identity system that aggregates verifiable credentials (on-chain + off-chain).
It allows users to prove claims like “I contributed to >50 GitHub commits” or “I participated in DAO governance” without revealing their full activity history.
This enables DAOs, employers, and Web3 projects to verify trustworthiness while preserving user privacy.

### SL Integration  
Proof generation occurs locally by the user’s wallet.

Soundness Layer (SL) is used for fast proof aggregation and verification.

vApp smart contracts deployed on SL validate zk-proofs of identity/reputation.

SL also ensures scalability by handling many proof submissions efficiently.

## Technical

### Architecture
Credential Sources: GitHub, DAO voting records, on-chain activity.

zk-Proof Generation: Users create zero-knowledge proofs locally.

Soundness Layer Integration:

Proofs submitted to SL verifier contracts.

SL ensures proof validity and aggregates claims.

User Flow:

Connect wallet + GitHub/DAO account.

zkID generates cryptographic commitments.

User submits zk-proof via vApp.

Verifier contract validates proof on SL.

### Stack
Frontend: React + Next.js

Backend: Node.js + Rust for proof circuits

Blockchain: Soundness Layer + Ethereum testnet

Storage: IPFS for credential commitments

### Features
Privacy-preserving credential verification.

zk-proofs of GitHub/DAO participation.

On-chain verifier contract integrated with SL.

## Timeline

PoC (2-4 weeks)

 Define credential schemas

 Implement proof generation & verification contracts

 Basic React UI

MVP (4-8 weeks)

 Expand to multiple credential sources

 User testing with DAO voting integration

## Innovation
Unlike traditional identity solutions that require revealing personal data, zkID Reputation Passport provides trust without exposure.
It enables DAOs, DeFi, and hiring platforms to validate user contributions while protecting privacy — making it both secure and user-friendly.
